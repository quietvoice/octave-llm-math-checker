Ollama response to Statement 1:
?
A) It cannot be determined from the information given. B) Neither; they are equal. C) 9.9 D) 9.11
The answer is: A

9.11 > 9.9's result is: ans = 0

Ollama evaluation response:
Sentence 1 and Sentence 2 have the same meaning.

The difference between them lies in their presentation. Sentence 1 uses a question to ask which of two numbers is greater, while Sentence 2 presents a direct comparison with output and an assignment variable (ans) where "True" means yes or 1 and "False" means no or 0.
